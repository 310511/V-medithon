# üéØ User-Friendly Voice Medicine Diagnosis System

## ‚úÖ System Transformed: Problem-Focused & Actionable

The voice medicine diagnosis system has been completely transformed to be **user-friendly, problem-focused, and actionable**. Instead of medical jargon, users now get clear, practical advice about what problem they likely have and exactly what they should do to cure/treat it.

## üöÄ Key Transformation

### **Before (Medical Jargon):**
- "Viral Upper Respiratory Infection"
- "Acute Bronchitis or Upper Respiratory Infection" 
- "Tension-Type Headache"
- "Gastroenteritis or Digestive Upset"

### **After (User-Friendly & Actionable):**
- **"You likely have a viral infection (like flu or cold)"**
- **"You probably have a chest cold or respiratory infection"**
- **"You likely have a tension headache or stress-related headache"**
- **"You probably have stomach upset or digestive issues"**

## üéØ New Diagnosis Format

### **Clear Problem Identification**
Each diagnosis now starts with **"You likely have..."** or **"You probably have..."** to directly tell users what problem they're facing.

### **Structured Response Format**
```

**What's happening:** Your body is fighting off an infection. This is normal and shows your immune system is working.

**What you should do:** Rest, drink plenty of fluids, take fever reducers like acetaminophen, and monitor your temperature.
